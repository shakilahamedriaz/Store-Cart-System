# 🛒 **Shopping Cart System in Python (OOP-Based)**

## 📌 **Overview**
This project is a simple **Object-Oriented Python application** that implements a shopping cart system. Customers can add products to their cart, view the cart, and make payments using different payment methods (Credit Card & PayPal).

The project showcases key **OOP principles** such as **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism**, making it a great example for learning and understanding Python's object-oriented features.

## ✨ **Key Features**
- ✅ **Product Management**: Create and manage products with attributes like name, price, and stock.  
- ✅ **Customer Management**: Assign customers to a shopping cart for adding products.  
- ✅ **Shopping Cart System**: Add products to the cart, calculate the total cost, and display items.  
- ✅ **Payment Processing**: Allows payment via **Credit Card** or **PayPal**, using an abstract base class for payment methods.  
- ✅ **OOP Principles**: Demonstrates **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.
